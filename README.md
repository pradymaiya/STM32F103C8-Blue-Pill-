1.) The "lcd" zip file contains the code that can be implemented in STM32CubeIDE ,this is built using STM32F103C8 (Blue Pill) ,LCD (using I2C Communication). For connection Port B pin number 6 and 7 are used for I2C communication.
All the other sensor files conatin program implemented using Arduino IDE, paste this link in preferences and install STM32F1X from board manager then choose the board and choose ST-Link(If using one and also install ST-Link driver from official website) under tools and upload the code,changing of boot pins are not necessary if you are uploading using Arduino IDE.
